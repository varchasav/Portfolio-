I am trying to understand if there is a well defined procedure to do
ASIC prototyping using FPGA.  I was thinking that I can divide down
the ASIC design into multiple functional blocks. Such that each block
represents asn ASIC.  The design is in verilog HDL but it contains a
lot ASIC lib specific instantiations.   This is not understood by the
FPGA software.  Here are the things that I am trying to understand

(1) How to convert the ASIC libreray specific primitive such that the
FPGA software can understand?
(2) The ASIC design uses LATCHES every now and then for time
borrowing, I am not sure if it is OK to use the LATCH in FPGA design.
(3) What is the exact procedure of analyzing large designs containing
thousands of verilog modules?  I ran experment on a few selected
modules and dicovered some issues described in 1 and 2.  I am sure a
lot people use FPGAs for ASIC prototyping and do they go through the
verilog moduel one at a time to make them work with the FPGA.
(4) Deisgn of what complexity can be targeted for ASIC prototyping?
The design I have may require multiple big FPGAs.  I wish I could
everything into one big FPGA
