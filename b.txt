A weather forecasting dashboard case study typically involves designing and implementing a system that visualizes weather data and forecasts for a specific location or region. This often includes collecting data from various sources, processing it, and presenting it in an intuitive and informative way on a user-friendly interface. The dashboard might incorporate real-time weather updates, historical data analysis, and predictive modeling to offer a comprehensive view of weather conditions. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of the key aspects of a weather forecasting dashboard case study:
1. Data Collection and Sources:
Real-time data:
Weather dashboards often pull data from various sources, including:
APIs: OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, and others offer weather data through APIs. 
Sensors: IoT-based weather stations can provide localized data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. 
Historical data:
Accessing archived weather data is crucial for training predictive models and analyzing trends. 
Satellite and radar data:
These sources provide valuable information on cloud cover, precipitation, and storm movements.
